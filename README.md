# Easy Twig

Get started with twig real quick and easy. Just start editing the `templates/page/index.html.twig` to start filling in your front page and `templates/base.html.twig` to modify the skeleton. To add a new page, for example a 'contact' page, just create the `templates/page/contact.html.twig` file and you're done!

If a page can not be found, the template `templates/error/404.html.twig` will be rendered.
